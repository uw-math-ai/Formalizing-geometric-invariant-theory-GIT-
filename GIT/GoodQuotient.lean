/-- **Helper predicate: local `Spec A → Spec A^G` structure.**

For a morphism `φ : X ⟶ Action.trivial G Y` in `Action Scheme G` and a per-open
`G`-action `ρ` on the local sections of `X.V` over preimages `φ⁻¹U`, this
predicate asserts that for every affine open `U ⊆ Y`, the structure-sheaf
pullback `φ.hom.app U : Γ(U, 𝒪_Y) → Γ(φ⁻¹U, 𝒪_X)` is injective and its image
is exactly the `G`-invariant sections.

This is the substantive content of "good quotient" beyond just being an affine
`G`-invariant morphism — locally `φ` looks like `Spec A → Spec A^G`.

The `G`-action `ρ` on local sections is taken as a hypothesis here; in a
complete formalization it should be derived from `X.ρ` together with the
`G`-invariance of `φ⁻¹U` (which follows from the equivariance of `φ`). -/

/-- **Definition: Good Quotient (skeleton).**

For a `G`-scheme `X : Action Scheme G`, a *good quotient* of `X` is the data of:

* a scheme `Y`,
* a morphism `φ : X ⟶ Action.trivial G Y` in `Action Scheme G` (since `Y`
  carries the trivial `G`-action, the morphism's equivariance condition
  `X.ρ g ≫ φ.hom = φ.hom ≫ (trivial G Y).ρ g` simplifies to
  `X.ρ g ≫ φ.hom = φ.hom`, i.e. `φ` is automatically `G`-invariant),
* a per-open `G`-action `ρ` on local sections of `X.V` over preimages `φ⁻¹U`,

satisfying:

1. **`isAffine`** — `φ` is an affine morphism;
2. **`invariantSections`** — locally `φ` looks like `Spec A → Spec A^G`;
   see `IsInvariantSections`.

The classical full definition adds three further conditions — surjectivity,
closed-image of `G`-invariant closed subsets, and separation of disjoint
closed `G`-invariant subsets — which can be added as additional fields when
needed. -/
